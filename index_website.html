            <h2><span class="emoji">📚</span>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This comprehensive digital humanities project presents an interactive geographical and temporal analysis of Islamic books published in Chinese during the late Qing Dynasty and Republican period (1863-1943). Through advanced GIS visualization techniques, we map the spatial distribution, temporal evolution, and migration patterns of 247 books across 12 Chinese publishing cities to 10 Japanese institutional repositories.</p>
            
            <p>The project integrates multiple data sources including bibliographic records, expert-curated metadata (58 fields), scholarly commentary (~12,000 characters), and OCR-extracted catalog data (16,809 characters from Tenri University), providing unprecedented insight into Sino-Japanese knowledge networks and the preservation of Chinese Islamic intellectual heritage.</p>

            <h2><span class="emoji">🔍</span>Key Historical Insights</h2>
            <p>These visualizations reveal significant patterns in the production, circulation, and preservation of Chinese Islamic texts. Understanding these patterns helps scholars recognize the importance of these sources and their availability for future research.</p>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>📍 Urban Concentration and Institutional Publishing</h4>
                <p>The maps reveal Beijing's overwhelming dominance as the center of Chinese Islamic publishing, accounting for 65% of all books (120 out of 185 geocoded titles). This concentration reflects the Republican-era centralization of print culture and the establishment of dedicated Islamic publishing houses. The 清眞書報社 (Qingzhen Shibao She) alone published 97 books, representing nearly 40% of the entire corpus. This institutional dominance transformed Islamic book production from scattered individual efforts into organized, systematic publishing operations. The visualization helps scholars identify major publishing centers and understand where to locate related archival materials.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>🌏 The "Book Road": Sino-Japanese Knowledge Networks</h4>
                <p>Perhaps the most striking pattern revealed by these visualizations is the migration of Chinese Islamic books to Japan. A remarkable 95% of the cataloged books are now preserved in Japanese institutions, with Tenri University holding 195 books (79% of the entire collection). This migration represents a critical chapter in East Asian intellectual history, showing how Japanese scholars and institutions systematically acquired Chinese Islamic texts during the Republican period. The network map visualization traces these flows, revealing not just preservation patterns but also scholarly interest and collecting practices that spanned national boundaries. For researchers, this means that accessing these sources requires engagement with Japanese institutional repositories, and the visualizations serve as a guide to these collections.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>🎨 Regional Intellectual Specialization</h4>
                <p>The thematic heatmaps reveal distinct patterns of regional specialization in Islamic scholarship. Beijing dominated periodical production, reflecting its role as a center of modern print media and intellectual discourse. In contrast, Yunnan and Sichuan provinces show higher concentrations of theological works, indicating the persistence of traditional Islamic learning in these regions with significant Muslim populations. This geographic differentiation suggests that Islamic intellectual production was not monolithic but adapted to local contexts, audiences, and scholarly traditions. These patterns help researchers understand where to look for different types of Islamic texts and scholarship.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>⏰ Temporal Dynamics and Historical Transitions</h4>
                <p>The 80-year publishing span (1863-1943) captured in these visualizations encompasses crucial transformations in Chinese history: the late Qing reforms, the Republican revolution, warlord period, and Japanese invasion. The temporal patterns show increased publishing activity during the Republican era, reflecting literacy campaigns, print technology improvements, and the flourishing of diverse intellectual movements. However, the abrupt end in 1943 marks the disruption caused by wartime conditions. Understanding these temporal dynamics helps scholars contextualize individual works within broader historical trajectories and recognize gaps in the publication record that may reflect political or social constraints.</p>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>🤝 Intellectual Networks and Scholarly Legitimation</h4>
                <p>The preface author network visualization reveals patterns of scholarly endorsement and intellectual authority within Chinese Islamic communities. Prefaces were not mere formalities but crucial mechanisms for establishing a book's legitimacy and connecting it to recognized scholarly lineages. The network maps show which scholars served as intellectual gatekeepers, lending their authority to new works. These patterns illuminate the social structures of Islamic scholarship in Republican China and help researchers trace intellectual genealogies and scholarly relationships that might not be obvious from the texts alone.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>📚 Making Rare Sources Discoverable</h4>
                <p>A primary goal of these visualizations is to make these rare books known to the broader scholarly community. Many of these texts are difficult to access, housed in Japanese repositories, and not widely cataloged in Western library systems. By mapping their locations, content types, publication patterns, and preservation institutions, these visualizations serve as a discovery tool. Researchers studying Chinese Islam, Republican-era print culture, Sino-Japanese intellectual exchanges, or Muslim minority communities can use these maps to identify relevant sources for their work. The comprehensive metadata integration means scholars can quickly assess which books might be relevant to their research questions without needing to physically visit multiple repositories.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>🔬 Methodological Innovation for Digital Humanities</h4>
                <p>These visualizations demonstrate how GIS and network analysis tools can transform our understanding of book history and intellectual networks. By spatializing bibliographic data, temporal patterns, and institutional connections become visible that would be difficult to perceive from traditional catalog listings. The multi-layered approach—combining spatial distribution, temporal evolution, thematic categorization, publisher networks, and migration flows—allows scholars to ask new questions about how knowledge circulated in early 20th-century China. This methodology can be applied to other collections, opening new research directions in Asian book history and transnational knowledge circulation.</p>

                <h4>🌍 Implications for Future Research</h4>
                <p>These visualizations open multiple research directions. Scholars can investigate why specific Japanese institutions collected these materials, trace the circulation networks that moved books from China to Japan, examine the relationship between publishing locations and content types, or study how Islamic intellectual production responded to China's tumultuous Republican period. The maps also reveal gaps—regions with few publications, time periods with limited output, and types of works that may be underrepresented. Identifying these gaps helps focus future collection efforts and research questions. Most importantly, by making these sources visible and their locations known, these visualizations enable the next generation of scholarship on Chinese Islamic intellectual history.</p>
